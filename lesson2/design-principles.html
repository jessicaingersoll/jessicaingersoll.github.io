        <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
        <img src="..images/Cleveland.Orchestra.jpg" alt="TCO mobile site"/>
        <p>This is the website for The Cleveland Orchestra. I think it's a great example of 
            visual heirarchy. Making the button to "Preview the Season" so large compared to 
        the other text on the page makes it obvious that they want you to click on this to go
    further into the site. It brings attention to the call to action not only from its size but also
        from making it's color white makes it stand out from the rest of the dark background of the page. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Principle-2">
            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <img src="..images/NWS.jpg" alt="NWS mobile site"/>
            <p>This is the website for the New World Symphony. I think it's an example of Hicks's 
                because it gives limited choices for the user to click on in the span of a screen. This 
                gives the user more focus on what they should choose to navigate to. The user only comes across
                maybe one or two choices at a time of what to click on.
