        <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>

        <p>This is the website for The Cleveland Orchestra. I think it's a great example of 
            visual heirarchy. Making the button to "Preview the Season" so large compared to 
        the other text on the page makes it obvious that they want you to click on this to go
    further into the site. It brings attention to the call to action not only from its size but also
        from making it's color white makes it stand out from the rest of the dark background of the page. </p>
