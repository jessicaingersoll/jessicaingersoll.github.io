  <h2>History of Miami Beach</h2>
  <img src="images/artdeco.jpg" alt="artdeco building"/>
  <p>Miami Beach land was first purchased by the father and son Henry and Charles
    Lum in 1870. They bought the land for 75 cents an acre. In 1876 the first building was
    constructed on the island by an executive order issued by President Ulysses S. Grant at 
    approximately what is now 72nd Street. It was called the Biscayne House of Refuge and it was 
    intended to provide food, water, and shelter for those who had been shipwrecked. Many tried 
    growing crops such as coconuts and avacados, to different degrees of success. The city of Miami
    was established in 1896 when the railrood was constructed there. The shipping Channel of Government
    Cut was made in 1905 which also developed the area. Various investors saw opportunity to develop
    Miami Beach as a resort location and in 1915 the first hotel, Brown's Hotel, was built. This hotel 
    is still standing at 122 Ocean Drive. It was expensive to make the land on the Beach suitable for 
    constructing buildings, but by 1913 the first bridge, Collins Bridge, from Miami to Miami Beach 
    was opened. The bridge cost $150,000 to construct and was later replaced by the now standing
    Venetian Causway. In 1915 the Town of Miami Beach was chartered and became a full blown city in 1917.
    The first skyscraper was the Lord Tarleton Hotel built in 1940. After World War II, there was 
    an influx of immigrants to South Florida which caused the population in Miami Beach to increase.
    In 1959 after Fidel Castro rose to power, a wave of Cuban refugees came to South Florida and 
    significantly changed the demographics of the area. In the 1990s, South Beach became a mecca of 
    the fashion industry and celebrities. South Beach is also know for its art deco style buildings.
