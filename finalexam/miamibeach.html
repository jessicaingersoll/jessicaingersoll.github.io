  <h2>History of Miami Beach</h2>
  <img src="images/artdeco.jpg" alt="artdeco building"/>
  <p>Miami Beach land was first purchased by the father and son Henry and Charles
    Lum in 1870. They bought the land for 75 cents an acre. In 1876 the first building was
    constructed on the island by an executive order issued by President Ulysses S. Grant at 
    approximately what is now 72nd Street. It was called the Biscayne House of Refuge and it was 
    intended to provide food, water, and shelter for those who had been shipwrecked. Many tried 
    growing crops such as coconuts and avacados, to different degrees of success. The city of Miami
    was established in 1896 when the railrood was constructed there. The shipping Channel of Government
    Cut was made in 1905 which also developed the area. Various investors saw opportunity to develop
    Miami Beach as a resort location and in 1915 the first hotel, Brown's Hotel, was built. This hotel 
    is still standing at 122 Ocean Drive. It was expensive to make the land on the Beach suitable for 
    constructing buildings, but by 1913 the first bridge, Collins Bridge, from Miami to Miami Beach 
    was opened. The bridge cost $150,000 to construct and was later replaced by the now standing
    Venetian Causway. In 1915 the Town of Miami Beach was chartered and became a full blown city in 1917.
    The first skyscraper was the Lord Tarleton Hotel built in 1940. After World War II, there was 
    an influx of immigrants to South Florida which caused the population in Miami Beach to increase.
    In 1959 after Fidel Castro rose to power, a wave of Cuban refugees came to South Florida and 
    significantly changed the demographics of the area. In the 1990s, South Beach became a mecca of 
    the fashion industry and celebrities. South Beach is also know for its art deco style buildings.

  <h3>South Beach Jazz Festival</h3>
  <p>Jan 8-10, 2021</p>
  <p>Music lovers, this is your chance to kick back, relax and listen to the smooth sounds 
    of jazz in always bustling South Beach. The 4th Annual South Beach Jazz Festival takes place on January 3 - 5, 2020, 
    with 14 performances featuring everything from traditional, contemporary, Latin and New Orleans style jazz. This festival
     is more than just music that moves you; it also puts a very important spotlight on world-renowned musicians who have disabilities. 
     The founder, David New, suffered a rare disease that left him paralyzed, blind and deaf, and now he works tirelessly to break down 
     barriers and to educate people about living and working with people with disabilities.

    The best part of this Miami Beach event — most of the Jazz Festival performances are free to the public and are sprinkled throughout 
    South Beach. Head to Lummus Park, which is situated on the ocean and famous Ocean Drive, on January 4 for “Jazz in Motion on Ocean” with top 
    musicians like Yainer Horta, Magela Herrera, Alfredo Chacon and Ruben Caban; Grammy-award winning drummer Jonathan Joseph will host a master class
     at Miami Beach Community Church; and Latin pianist Kiki Sanchez will lead a jazz ensemble at Capital One Cafe. Expect performers like percussionist 
     Sammy Figueroa, pianist Fanni Sarkozy, jazz vocalist Ashley Pezzotti and William Cepeda at the Euclid Circle stage on January 5. You can also listen 
     to the sounds of Nicole Yarling at 1111 Lincoln Road and on the same night, catch the popular flick “Ray,” a drama about the genius of blind, pop/jazz 
     singer, Ray Charles, on the big screen at Soundscape Park at the New World Center.</p>

       <h3>Art Deco Weekend</h3>
       <img src="images/jazzfestival.png" alt="jazz festival"/>
       <p>Jan: 14-16</p>
       <p>Art Deco Weekend brings people together for three days of fun, history, design and architecture

        Today’s Miami is a haven for all kinds of art and artists, but historically, it’s most known for Art Deco. Launched in 1976 by the nonprofit organization 
        Miami Design Preservation League (MDPL), Art Deco Weekend is a three-day celebration of that movement — a weekend filled with art, architecture, history, 
        culture, entertainment and more. Originally created as a way to bring more people to Miami Beach at a time when tourism was low and preserving Art Deco history
         wasn’t a priority, today, this popular annual event is still the longest-running free community cultural festival in Miami Beach.
        
        Returning to our South Beach shores on January 15th, 2021, this year’s festival will be virtual for the first time.
        
        <h4>Miami’s Art Deco History</h4>
        Dating back to the 1930s, Miami’s Art Deco movement is an indelible part of South Florida history. Found all along Ocean Drive, Collins Avenue and its surrounding area,
         Art Deco architecture is easily recognizable—it’s bright and colorful, with playful shapes and glamorous elements that simultaneously make them both adorable and ostentatious.
        
        Despite their noticeable traits, the collection of more than 800 buildings that make up Miami’s Art Deco scene went virtually unnoticed until 1976, when the Miami Design Preservation 
        League formed to preserve, protect and promote the architectural, cultural, social and environmental integrity of Miami Beach. Highlighting the significance of the Art Deco movement, 
        this organization fought to get the buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, making Miami’s Art Deco Historic District the first nationally-recognized, 20th-century
         urban neighborhood in America.</p>
